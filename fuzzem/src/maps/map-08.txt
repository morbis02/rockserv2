A host of shimmering glyphs cover its silvery surface, each glowing with an inner light ranging from cyan to magenta in coloring. Capable of stabilizing rifts in space, the technology used to design planar gates has yet to be duplicated by any. All those existing today are remnants of some long forgotten race, having survived for millenniums. For this reason they are widely sought after, and even the most destructive of races do not dare to destroy one.&MAPNAME=En'whel Academy&MSGID=39&OWN=kler&SAFE=2&STATIC_ID=1211031161071001&MAXINV=100&PORTAL=8&MAXM=0&DESC=    A cleared niche between two sprawling mountain ranges snugly holds a planar gate here, sheltering it from adverse winds and thunder storms. The metallic surface of the gate is kept polished, causing it to gleam brightly whenever light hits it. The series of high mountainous peaks head off to the east, leaving between them a sprawling woodland realm that flourishes with life. Trees of all varieties spring up from the rich soil, spreading forth canopies of greens, reds, blues, and golds to create a gorgeous view of nature's potential. A path, starting at the planar gate, winds its way through this vale, towards a sparkling construct off in the distance.&NAME=Lush Vale of the En'whel, Clearing near a Planar Gate&PNAME=planar gate&TYPE=-1&GRAV=9.8&CRYL=0&LEV=0
