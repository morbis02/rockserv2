The platform is several dozen yards long, created of white brick and suspended in the air by a magical force. A large area of the platform is dominated by a hanging garden, which drapes down from bronzed poles. The lush vegetation is well tended, their vines tamed by a collection of master gardeners. Small trees stand amidst the poles, adding their greenery to the elegant scene. In all directions different platform are visible in the distance, each one resting comfortably in the sky. Many hold aloft towering buildings, all sharing a similar architectural design consisting of slender towers of white stone and wide, opened balconies. A series of arching walkways connect many of the platforms, built by the Shi-kul to accommodate the occasional wingless visitor.&BIRTH=936750629&TYPE=-1
