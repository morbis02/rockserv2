A host of shimmering glyphs cover its silvery surface, each glowing with an inner light ranging from cyan to magenta in coloring. Capable of stabilizing rifts in space, the technology used to design planar gates has yet to be duplicated by any. All those existing today are remnants of some long forgotten race, having survived for millenniums. For this reason they are widely sought after, and even the most destructive of races do not dare to destroy one.&SW-1=1&MSGID=36&OWN=morbis&STATIC_ID=1071141071131201&PORTAL=20&DESC=Nestled amidst the towering trees, the dull circular shape of a planar gate can be seen.

Here the hall opens up into a large room, perhaps fifty paces from wall to wall. Large Torches are scattered throughout the room, burning a crimson red, and without the aid of fuel. You wonder what foul engeries could power so many lights to do so. Racks along the walls are covered with every time of torture device you've ever seen, and many you can even imagine the use for. A large, raised altar in the center of the room seems to be the focus of its dark energies. Archaic symbols line the floor around the altar, many giving off strange glows and whisps of magical energy.&NAME=A Sacrificial Altar within the Azral Temple&TYPE=-1&CRYL=0
