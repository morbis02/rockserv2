What little illumination survives within the black heart of the Twilight Plane reveals only the surrounding inky darkness. Twisting spires of rock jut up from the ground, like vicious teeth of some ancient beast. Their curved length stretch half way up to the vaulted ceiling. Several of these stalagmites create a circular enclosure in the chamber's center. A raised dais can be seen within this enclosure, housing the citadel's power supply.

They vary in size, but must are large enough to easily store an adult human with room to spare. Black slime oozes throughout the cylinders, blanketing its prisoner within its organic embrace. A least a half dozen stone tables can be seen, carved from the black rock of the cavern's floor. Most are bare, except for the occasional scientific experiment.
