Stuck at the farthest rim of the web, its small size and endless heat provides little to those who travel here. Those who have set up a permanent residence here are either wanted by the law or lack the resources to live anywhere else. The town of Varmoth is the sole population center located here, built in the center of a desert wasteland. Most of the houses are crafted from aged rotting wood, dusted with thick layers of sand. They stand like skeletal remains, empty save for the occasional scorpion or bandit. A wide ring of bleached rocks are placed in the central square of town, circling the rusting planar gate that provides access to the dimensional nexus.

Its plush padding has been worn down, though the Thrakian emblem is still clearly visible. A long table runs along the room, taking up most of the remaining space.
