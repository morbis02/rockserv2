The shifting lights of the planar barriers can just barely been seen through the sphere's frosted outer wall, as it sways to and fro within the invisible current that leads endlessly onwards. These collections of multicolored illumination mark the boundaries of each plane, walls that separate different cultures, civilizations, and even realities. There environment within the sphere is far below freezing, turning any humidity to ice within seconds. Frozen masses float aimlessly about the sphere, imprisoned beings that were deemed too villainous to interact with the world outside.&NAME=Sphere of Free Floating Frost&TYPE=-1&LCOM=did not&CPU=0&SAVE=1&GRAV=9.8&RALIAS=frozenroom&CRYL=0&LEV=0
