Nexus of the Dimensional Web
Swirling eddies of golden energy dance around through the dimensional web's
nexus. The horizon is the color of deep sapphires, a blue that stretches on
forever in almost every direction. Wide twisting paths of solidified space
loop their way throughout the nexus, creating stable ground for those
daring to travel through the nexus. Some of these paths have been formed
naturally over centuries, though most were created by the ancient race that
first discovered planar travel. Older then even the Dryne, this unknown
race is responsible for most of the construction here, including the few
stable planar gates that lead off into different dimensions.

Through the scryball, you see: Melal's Chamber
The royal wizard, Melal, resides within this spacious chamber located at
the castle's highest peak. The room is well organized, with one section
along the eastern wall devoted to racks of vials and beakers containing an
exotic array of animal species and mystical ingredients. The central area
of the stone floor is covered with a powerful summoning circle, used during
the most dangerous of magical experiments. Braziers surround the circle,
and much of the room, providing a gentle light along with a green haze
laced with some sort of chemical. A sole opening in the northern wall leads
out onto a balcony, which overlooks the entire westlander city and the
surrounding forest. From this vantage point it is even possible to make out
the glittering line of the Silver River far off to the east.

Through the scryball, you see: Melal's Chamber
The royal wizard, Melal, resides within this spacious chamber located at
the castle's highest peak. The room is well organized, with one section
along the eastern wall devoted to racks of vials and beakers containing an
exotic array of animal species and mystical ingredients. The central area
of the stone floor is covered with a powerful summoning circle, used during
the most dangerous of magical experiments. Braziers surround the circle,
and much of the room, providing a gentle light along with a green haze
laced with some sort of chemical. A sole opening in the northern wall leads
out onto a balcony, which overlooks the entire westlander city and the
surrounding forest. From this vantage point it is even possible to make out
the glittering line of the Silver River far off to the east.
