The town of Varmoth is the sole population center located here, built in the center of a desert wasteland. Most of the houses are crafted from aged rotting wood, dusted with thick layers of sand. They stand like skeletal remains, empty save for the occasional scorpion or bandit.

Tied together by powerful dark magic, the throne looks like it has stood their for ages, and would stand for countless more. Just behind this gruesome throne, a swirling seal of energy has collected.

Capable of stabilizing rifts in space, the technology used to design planar gates has yet to be duplicated by any.

Trees of all varieties spring up from the rich soil, spreading forth canopies of greens, reds, blues, and golds to create a gorgeous view of nature's potential.
