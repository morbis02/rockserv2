You stare blankly at the wall
%S stares blankly at the wall.
You stare dreamily at %R, completely lost in %HR eyes.
%S is staring at you. It's better not to know what %PS is thinking about you!
%S is staring at %R. A strand of drool hangs from %HS mouth.
You step back and look at everyone from afar.
%S is stepping back, staring at everyone.
