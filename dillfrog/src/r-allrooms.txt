A host of shimmering glyphs cover its silvery surface, each glowing with an inner light ranging from cyan to magenta in coloring. Capable of stabilizing rifts in space, the technology used to design planar gates has yet to be duplicated by any. All those existing today are remnants of some long forgotten race, having survived for millenniums. For this reason they are widely sought after, and even the most destructive of races do not dare to destroy one.&MSGID=312&OWN=ionidas&STATIC_ID=97112119115971&PNOENTER=1&PVPROOM=1&PORTAL=17&DESC=Bitter, choking fog dominates the surface of the battlegrounds.
