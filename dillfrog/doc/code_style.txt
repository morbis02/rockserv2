NOTE: This doc is old, and might be a little confusing. But it's
the closest thing we already have to a code style guide. Granted,
given the mess we have to work with, I'm not probably the best person
to talk about coding style. But I've learned a lot from all this
trial-and-error. Really. :) :)

A lot of it is based on my personal preference, but that's the breaks.



Style Guidelines
---------------------------------

New subroutines should have descriptions at the top of each sub.
They don't need to be complex, but should be able to describe what the function
does, what the inputs are, and what the function returns (if non-void).

When someone gives bad input to the function and the function displays a
friendly error, if it is a user error, show the user a friendly error message,
including syntax.


COMMENTS

Comments should have one space separating the text from the comment
marker. For example:

    #this is BAD
    # This is GOOD
    #  This is BAD
 
An exception to the rule would be when commenting out code. In this case, try
not to use 1 space (zero, or more than one space, are OK).


BRACES / INDENTATION / SPACING

K&R bracing conserves vertical whitespace, and should be used
(none of this one-brace-on-a-line-of-its-own stuff, unless you
had to wrap a long function line).

To increase legibility, there should be a space between
keywords and parentheses, for example:
    NOT:  if(condition){
    GOOD: if (condition) {
    NOT:  while(condition){
    GOOD: while (condition) {

Indentation should be 4 spaces at a time. Make sure your text
editor does NOT insert the "tab" character, but rather sets of
4 spaces.
