W=84&N=82&S=78&E=83&MSGID=643&MAXINV=1000&DB=11&DESC=The Plane of Desolation is not one of the great tourist attractions of the Dimensional Web. Stuck at the farthest rim of the web, its small size and endless heat provides little to those who travel here. Those who have set up a permanent residence here are either wanted by the law or lack the resources to live anywhere else. The town of Varmoth is the sole population center located here, built in the center of a desert wasteland. Most of the houses are crafted from aged rotting wood, dusted with thick layers of sand. They stand like skeletal remains, empty save for the occasional scorpion or bandit. A wide ring of bleached rocks are placed in the central square of town, circling the rusting planar gate that provides access to the dimensional nexus. A dusty road leads off to the north, east, west, and south into different parts of town.&GRAV=9.8&MAXH=2&PINVIS=0&MAXM=0&RALIAS=varmoth-square&BIRTH=900152755&NAME=Central Square in Varmoth&PDESC=This strange metallic device is shaped like a gigantic hoop, allowing passage through it for even the largest of travelers.

Capable of stabilizing rifts in space, the technology used to design planar gates has yet to be duplicated by any. All those existing today are remnants of some long forgotten race, having survived for millenniums. For this reason they are widely sought after, and even the most destructive of races do not dare to destroy one.&ROOM=80&CRYL=0&TYPE=-1&LEV=0&PORTAL=3&STATIC_ID=971211171191171&OWN=kler&PNAME=planar gate&AOFFSET=0&TER=5
